title: The bathmetry measurement begins with base stations

<h2>ASSEMBLY</h2>
<p>Once arriving on site, set up is relatively quick. The best place to park and the best point to launch the boat is scoped on foot. This is usually provided by maintenance access ways which are pathways built into pond designs to allow for machinery to access the pond for dredging. The boat is assembled near the launch point into the pond. This requires attaching the propellers to the rear of the boat, connecting and strapping in the boat batteries, positioning the ADCP into the holder in the centre of the boat, and connecting the cables to the Program Control Module (PCM), radio and GPS. Once set up, the boat can be heavy to lift and usually requires two people to carry it. Photograph 1 below shows the boat once assembled and deployed.</p>

<div id="calibration-and-connection" class="section level2">
<h2>CALIBRATION AND CONNECTION</h2>
<p>Calibration of the compass is carried out using RiverSurveyor software on the laptop or tablet. This was done away from any magnetic interference such as a bridge or steel posts (Mueller, 2012). Several 360 degree rotations of the boat were made, while simulating the pitch and roll of the boat that is expected while surveying the pond. Once calibration is passed, HydroSurveyor software wasused to undertake the survey of the river. A new file was created for each transect surveyed, with the survey area added onto the appropriate point on the map. The first time a survey is carried out, the appropriate measurements and offsets in relation to a central reference point (CRP) need to be entered to ensure the correct boat set up is provided to Hydrosurveyor. However for subsequent ponds, previous surveys can be used as a template to save time. The ADCP and GPS must be connected through HydroSurveyor and within range before surveying can commence.</p>

<h2>COLLECTING DATA</h2>
<p>The boat is then lifted and placed into the water near the edge of the pond. The remote control is turned on, then the lid of the boat is opened and the ignition turned on the boat. The propellers will now be operational. In HydroSurveyor, data collection is started, and the boat is driven around the pond using the remote control. On the laptop, the path the boat has taken will be shown, alongside the depth soundings and the interpolated bathymetry. Although the boat is capable of travelling at speeds of up to 1.8 m/s, the boat should not be driven at full speed. A sounding is obtained every second, therefore if the boat is driven too quickly, less data is collected. A methodical path should be taken to cover the pond, starting with the perimeter of the pond, and then filling in the centre with vertical and horizontal lines. Post survey data processing will interpolate between the points and fill in any gaps that were not surveyed, so it is not essential to cover the entire pond surface. An example of acceptable coverage of a pond is shown in Figure 1 below. The blue lines represent the path of the boat.</p>
