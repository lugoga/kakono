## Introduction
The Government of Tanzania wishes to construct the 87 MW Kakono HPP in north-western Tanzania near the 
border with Uganda and 90km west of Bukoba located on the eastern shore of Lake Victoria (Figure 1). The 
dam site is approximately 36 km upstream of Kyaka Ferry (in a direct line). The HPP involves a 38 m high dam 
wall extending 1.5 km across the Kagera River, and a 220kV transmission line and access road (the Project). 
The reservoir will extend 28 km upstream in the Kagera River and cover an area of 16 km2.

 The Project is being developed by Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (TANESCO) to supply much needed power for the 
national grid. The French Agency for Development (Agence Française de Développement - AFD) are considering co-financing 
the Project in association with other potential lenders comprising the African Development Bank (AfDB), the 
European Union (EU), and the Norwegian Embassy in Tanzania. AFD has engaged SLR France to carry out 
Complementary Environmental and Social Studies for the Project.
The purpose of the Complementary E&S Studies is to complement and update the Project’s existing 
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) documentation from 2014 and 2017 to ensure compliance 
with the potential lenders E&S policies and standards.

## Objectives of the bathymetry survey
As the Kakono HPP may affect the hydrology in both the river channel and the flood plain, there is a need to 
model how the river system would respond to the hydrological changes triggered by the Project. Topographic 
data plays an essential role in hydraulic modelling of rivers. A high‐precision digital elevation model (DEM) 
including river bathymetry (bed topography) and flood plain topography would therefore be required for the 
reach Kagera River to be modelled.
The present bathymetry survey will target the Kagera riverbed only.
The present scope aims at defining the locations of the river cross-sections to be surveyed at the Kagera River 
downstream of the future Kakono Dam. The technical specifications and the list of deliverables are also 
presented.
